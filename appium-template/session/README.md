# Template Session Folder

Contents of this folder must be:

- _app.apk_ or _app.zip_ depending on the platform
- _sessionData.json_

**Appium Session Generator** will copy its entire template folder into a temporary place. Then it will replace contents of this folder with the files collected from the instrumented app.
