This project is an automatically generated Flutter driver test, powered by TestFairy.

### Configuration

Before running the tests, make sure you search for `EDITME` inside any dart file and replace the values as you see fit.

### Run

- To execute tests locally, copy the generated zip contents into your Flutter app project root.

- Run `flutter drive --enable-experiment=non-nullable --no-sound-null-safety -v --target=test_driver/app.dart`
